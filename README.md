## Project by Sanghmitra Sisodiya 

## About Dataset
Analysis of the top rated restaurants in the city of Mumbai according to Swiggy which is a popular online food ordering and delivery platform based in India. 
This set of data was obtained from **Kaggle** , which was initially obtained by web scraping from the Swiggy website.
The set contains all the outlets in the city that have a rating of 4 or above. 
It mentions their ratings, the type of food they specialize in, their average delivery time, average cost and if there are any offers or coupons that can be used to get a better deal.

## Feel free to go through the dataset and project.
